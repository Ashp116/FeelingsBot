# Feelings Bot
This is a sentiment analysis project that used the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/emotions/data) to create a model to analyze sentences and tell us 
what type of emotion it expresses. 

This project uses the MultinomialNB classifier to analyze and train the sentiment AI.
